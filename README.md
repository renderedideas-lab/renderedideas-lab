Hello, I'm Danilo Bleul from Germany.
Long time ago I found my passion in Informatics and Pascal as my favorite programming language. And I swear I'll help keeping the soul of this dying sector alive.
Therefore I joined the project "fpos" founded by "rezgui". I think it's better to give Pascal or FreePascal a second [hardware-near] birth than a first total disappearance.
Well, maybe I'll start and publish an own project soon... Who knows...
